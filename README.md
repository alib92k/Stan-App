How did you decide on the structure and framework of your solution?
I did some research based on the examples that were provided and I found cypress easier to understand/use and thought it would be suitable for this task.

Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
Write more test scripts and run more tests. Also would like to finish a few of the test scripts I was stuck on.

What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
Increase diversity of tests, expand capability - I wouldâ€™ve liked to get the login working and be able to write few more test scripts (e.g. play content/sign out), as I was stuck on the ReCAPTCHA for the login and implementing the headless browser.
Also, I would like to study the structure and framework a bit better and have experience with this.
